#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices. 
importance of software engineering
software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-the development of programming languages developed by IBM in the 1950s primarily for scientific computing tasks on the IBM 704 computer. 
It introduced concepts like loops, arrays, and subroutines, making it easier to write complex mathematical calculations compared to earlier machine code. 
Became a standard for scientific computing and numerical analysis, with continued evolution and updates throughout the years. 
-the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s  as computers became more complex, the need for specialised software developers became apparent. This led to the birth of software engineering as a distinct discipline. 'Software engineering' was first used in the late 1960s during a NATO conference on software engineering
-the advent of structured programming in the 1970s Structured programming began in the early 1970s, and was a major step forward in software engineering. It introduced a new way of writing software that emphasized logical structures and procedures. This made it easier to understand and debug software. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-the waterfall project management method is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline. It involves rigorous planning upfront to ensure that the project stays on track, with progress tracked closely and issues addressed promptly. The Waterfall model usually includes five project management stages (or phases): initiation, planning, execution, monitoring/control, and closing.
-Agile project management is a flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and 
high-quality results within shorter timeframes. It’s very often used in software development
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer is responsible for writing the code and implementing software solutions for a code to effectively run.
-Quality assurance engineer is responsible for software quality by designing and executing test plans and finding bugs in a software.
-Project manager is responsible for the overall planning and executing and delivering software projects assigned to them.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Intergrated development environments software suites that provide software tools for writing code testing and debugging code eg visual studio and eclipse
-Version control systems software tools for tracking code changes to source code and coordinating work among colleagues.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Requirements may change within the software lifecycle leading to scope of creep and delay to the project finishing dates hence effective communication should be provided to the team to avoid such challenges from occuring while plans are already in place.
-Pressure to the software development leading to rushed development and low quality of code being provided. Acollaborative iterative approach tha t involves breaking down tasks into phases and continous improvement of throughput should be adopted.
-Technical dept shortcut during a software lifecycle can lead to high cost of maintance and next to impossible improvements to the code as compared to the cost incurred to create the software hence effective budget allocations is neccesary

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components of a software .
intergration testing testing interactions between different components and subsystems.
system testing focuses on the overall behavior and capabilities of the entire system or product.
acceptance testing focuses on validation and on demonstrating the readinessfor deployment which means the product or system fulfills its purpose.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering involves crafting the best quality of questions and statements to get the best response from AI models 
-Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance: Well-engineered prompts significantly improve the quality of AI-generated responses, ensuring they align with the user's intent.   
-Increased Control: It gives users greater control over AI behavior, allowing them to steer the model towards desired outcomes and prevent unwanted or inaccurate outputs.   
-Improved Efficiency: Effective prompting reduces the need for extensive post-processing and editing of AI-generated content, saving time and resources.   
-Mitigation of Bias: Prompt engineering can help mitigate biases present in AI models by carefully crafting prompts that promote fairness and inclusivity.   
-Expanded Capabilities: It unlocks the full potential of AI models, enabling them to perform complex tasks, generate creative content, and provide insightful information.   
-Better User Experience: when prompts are well made, the interaction between the user and the AI is much more fluid, and productive.   
-Real world application: From generating code, to writing marketing copy, to helping doctors with diagnosis, Prompt engineering is becoming essential in many professional fields.
